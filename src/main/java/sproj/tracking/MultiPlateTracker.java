/**
 * Similar to SinglePlateTracker class, this class iterates through the input video feed (from a file or a camera device),
 * and implements tracking functions to record the movement data of the subject animals. The main difference is that
 * this is specifically designed for multi-plate tracking, where each animal is in a separate petri dish, which
 * removes the complication of having collisions and occlusions, and also allows constraints to be made on each animal's
 * possible range of location and motion within the overall video frame.
 *
 * The recorded data is intermittently passed to the IOUtils class to be written (or appended) to file.
